"""
Short writeup:
  - Decompile apk along with the dex file and see that MainActivity have so
    many calcN (calc0 ... calc299) functions

  - We can also see that there is one native calc function there and that its
    called when a button is clicked

  - We can also see data from the EditText is passed into the calc function

  - Analyze the binary (statically) in libs dir (choose any arch) then see the
    exposed calc function (since this is a shared lib) and im already generous
    enough to rewrite the code purely in C to make it easier lol

  - We can see that calc native function actually call one of the calcN functions
    where N will be randomized between 0-299, and then all these calcN functions
    will do some operations on the input, and then call the calc native function
    back again (recursion...)

  - By reading more on the decompiled code of the libfishy.so, we would know that
    there exist a base case that will happen if calc native function is trying to
    call one of non-existing calcN function (e.g. calc300) in which case it will

    1. check if input argument == "133713371337", return "wrong" if incorrect
       otherwise continue
    2. grab a resource string named "flag" which is
       "you_really_think_this_is_the_flag_huh_????"
    3. then xor it with the value we supply in the EditText
    4. return the xor result (which is the actual flag)

  - It means that our main target now is to find out what value we have to supply
    to the EditText in such a way that the input will become "133713371337"

  - But before that, one thing we have to know is how do we reach the base case?
    and the answer is we need to find one of calc native function call where pos
    argument is given non-existing N (which is 300 or more in this case)

  - Then we know there are only two function that will reach this, so same question
    arise, how to reach any of these two functions? yep, we have to backtrack these
    two functions to get to the root fn (which should be the first fn call)

  - But we can also see that the pos argument in the calc native function call inside
    the button onClick is actually randomized, yeah this is another hassle where the
    hacker have to be able to change this such that they could pass in any value to
    the pos argument (there are sooo many ways to do this, so i'll leave this as an
    excercise)

  - Once we know which function to call first, we will understand that all these calcN
    functions are just doing arithmetic operations on the input value we supply in the
    EditText and so we can get the actual input we have to pass in by putting all these
    equations to an SMT Solver (z3, cvc5, etc) or not if you watch carefully (SMT Solver
    is not required at all to solve this challenge)

  - Pass in the correct input, and the correct pos argument, then win!

  NOTE: Most of the solution code here is Penned via standard programming aids so if chatgpt can solve it,
        then you can too :wink:
