"""please write a python program that reads a continuous input of NMEA senetences on a TCP socket and republishes them on a different UDP stream

Certainly! Below is a Python program that sets up a TCP server to read NMEA sentences and then republishes them on a UDP stream. The program uses the socket library for network communication.

Make sure to run the TCP client and UDP listener scripts on the same machine where the TCP to UDP relay program is running, or adjust the IP addresses accordingly if they are on different machines.
