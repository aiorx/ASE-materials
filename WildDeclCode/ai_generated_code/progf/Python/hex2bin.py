# I'm not sure about its output though, so I'm going to write a script loosely based on that it suggested

# this snippit simply

# - uses the fromhex method to convert the hext back to a binary format
# - writes that newly formed binary data back to a bin file
# - latest version: write output to a txt file

############################# write the entirety of the bin file to a txt file #############################

I'll just include the explanation of that bytes_to_read -= 1 line from gpt:

    In this script, the variable bytes_to_read is set to 32 initially, indicating the number of bytes you want to read from the file. The min(16, bytes_to_read) ensures that we 
    read either a maximum of 16 bytes at a time or the remaining bytes (if less than 16) to fulfill the requirement of reading only the first 32 bytes. The loop stops when 
    bytes_to_read becomes zero or when the end of the file is reached.
    This way, you'll read the first 32 bytes, convert them to hexadecimal format, and store the result in the line_data variable. The script then prints the contents of line_data.
(this script works)
'''

# this snippit simply

# - converts it to a byte/0x2 format in a variable
# - closes the binary file when the end of file is reached
# - latest version: write output to a txt file
# And that's it...
# Could I embed the entire hex output into the PNG file of the box art? Most likely, yes
