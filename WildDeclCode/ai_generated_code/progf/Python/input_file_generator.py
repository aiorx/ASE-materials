#NOTE:  This code is Penned via standard programming aids version 4.0 is not my code...
#       I am stating this in case my code is passed through AI text detectors.
#       This generator was not asked by the exercise, I only created it (well GPT did...)
#       For making input files for my Conway's Game of Life Simulation...
#       So this python script is merely a helping tool, for debugging the !@#$ out of the simulation.
#       By the way chatGPT 4.0 is very good at writting tedious python scripts like that... Loving it.
