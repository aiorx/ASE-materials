#
# please write a short python program using biopython that can read
# the output from command-line blastn and merge all the HSP results
# into a set of per-hit (query, subject pairs), just as the website does. 
# Use existing packages to keep the code concise. 
# 
# Prompt2 
#
# Very good. Instead of just summing the hsp.align_length and
# hsp.identities, do correct overlap calculations to compute what
# percentage of the query sequence is covered by the any hsp. When
# processing and HSP, compute how much of that HSP covers query
# sequence that has not yet been overlapped by an HSP, and only add in
# the percentage of the hsp's identity score that matches the
# percentage of the hsp's length that is not already covered by
# previous hsps.
