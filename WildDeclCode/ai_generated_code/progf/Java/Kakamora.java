/*
Task 1: Kakamora
You will be given a series of NxN grids where each square contains the population of the Kakamora. 
The first line will contain the number of squares in each direction N, followed by the NxN grid itself. 
You may assume N is no larger than 100. The end of input will be denoted by a 0 as the value of N.
Moana only moves east, south, or south-east from one square to another until she reaches the final location.
For each grid, output the minimum number of Kakamora encountered on one line, followed by the path taken on the next 
(indicate paths by printing the sequence of squares visited as denoted by the Kakamora population).

Sample Input
5       
1 5 2 3 6
4 3 2 1 2
3 8 9 2 1
0 5 2 3 4
3 1 4 2 1
Sample Output
12
1 3 2 2 3 1

Your task:
The following code is Aided with basic GitHub coding tools. You need to modify the code to make it work.
