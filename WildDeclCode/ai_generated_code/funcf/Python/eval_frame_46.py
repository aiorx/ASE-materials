```python
    Export an input function f to a format that can be executed outside of PyTorch using the FX graph.

    Args:
        f (callable): A PyTorch function to be exported.

        aten_graph (bool): If True, exports a graph with ATen operators.
        If False, exports a graph with Python operators. Default is False.

        pre_dispatch (bool): If True, exports a graph with ATen operators,
        but before any logic in the PyTorch dispatcher has run.
        This can be useful if you want to apply further transformations on a graph before running it
        through autograd, autocast, or any other functionalities that are integrated into the dispatcher.
        This flag is only valid if aten_graph=True is set.
        Default is False.

        decomposition_table (dict): A dictionary that maps operators to their decomposition functions.
        Required if aten_graph or tracing_mode is specified. Default is None.

        tracing_mode (str): If "symbolic", turn on dynamic shapes support. Default is "symbolic".

        constraints: [DEPRECATED: use ``dynamic_shapes`` instead, see below]
         An optional list of constraints on the dynamic arguments
         that specify their possible range of shapes. By default, shapes of
         input torch.Tensors are assumed to be static. If an input torch.Tensor
         is expected to have dynamic shapes, please use :func:`dynamic_dim`
         to define :class:`Constraint` objects that specify the dynamics and the possible
         range of shapes. See :func:`dynamic_dim` docstring for examples on
         how to use it.

        dynamic_shapes:
         An optional argument where the type should either be:
         1) a dict from argument names of ``f`` to their dynamic shape specifications,
         2) a tuple that specifies dynamic shape specifications for each input in original order.
         If you are specifying dynamism on keyword args, you will need to pass them in the order that
         is defined in the original function signature.

         The dynamic shape of a tensor argument can be specified as either
         (1) a dict from dynamic dimension indices to :func:`Dim` types, where it is
         not required to include static dimension indices in this dict, but when they are,
         they should be mapped to None; or (2) a tuple / list of :func:`Dim` types or None,
         where the :func:`Dim` types correspond to dynamic dimensions, and static dimensions
         are denoted by None. Arguments that are dicts or tuples / lists of tensors are
         recursively specified by using mappings or sequences of contained specifications.

        same_signature (bool): If True, rewrite the returned graph's signature to be the same as f.

        disable_constraint_solver (bool): Whether the dim constraint solver must be disabled.

    Returns:
        A function that given args and kwargs, returns a tuple of (graph, guards)
        Graph: An FX graph representing the execution of the input PyTorch function with the provided arguments and options.
        Guards: The guards we accumulated during tracing f above

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If decomposition_table is specified without setting aten_graph=True,
        or if graph breaks during tracing in export.

        AssertionError: If Dynamo input and output is not consistent with traced input/output.
