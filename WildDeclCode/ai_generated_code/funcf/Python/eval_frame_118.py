```python
    Export an input function f to a format that can be executed outside of PyTorch using the FX graph.

    Args:
        f (callable): A PyTorch function to be exported.

        aten_graph (bool): If True, exports a graph with ATen operators.
        If False, exports a graph with Python operators. Default is False.

        pre_dispatch (bool): If True, exports a graph with ATen operators,
        but before any logic in the PyTorch dispatcher has run.
        This can be useful if you want to apply further transformations on a graph before running it
        through autograd, autocast, or any other functionalities that are integrated into the dispatcher.
        This flag is only valid if aten_graph=True is set.
        Default is False.

        decomposition_table (dict): A dictionary that maps operators to their decomposition functions.
        Required if aten_graph or tracing_mode is specified. Default is None.

        tracing_mode (str): If "symbolic", turn on dynamic shapes support. Default is "symbolic".

        same_signature (bool): If True, rewrite the returned graph's signature to be the same as f.

    Returns:
        A function that given args and kwargs, returns a tuple of (graph, guards)
        Graph: An FX graph representing the execution of the input PyTorch function with the provided arguments and options.
        Guards: The guards we accumulated during tracing f above

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If decomposition_table is specified without setting aten_graph=True,
        or if graph breaks during tracing in export.

        AssertionError: If Dynamo input and output is not consistent with traced input/output.
